Therefore, WOPI locks must:

            Be associated with a single file.

            Contain a lock ID of maximum length 1024 ASCII characters.

            Prevent all changes to that file unless a proper lock ID is provided.

            Expire after 30 minutes unless refreshed. For more information, see RefreshLock.

            Not be associated with a particular user.
